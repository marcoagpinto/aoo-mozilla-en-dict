![Project Logo](assets/logo_2025+.png)

For many years that people stopped maintaining dictionaries for open-source software.

It would be great to continue their work and improve existing dictionaries or create new ones.

The biggest issue is that most of these dictionaries are obfuscated <B>(codified in a way that only certain software packages can access the wordlists)</B> and the original developers are long-gone to provide the clean text ones.

In some cases, we will have to start from a long-time position, the last known clean text version of the dictionaries.

Modifying, updating and maintaining a dictionary is a hard, important task for current and future generations.

The dictionaries in this repository are the most recent versions available, making it easier for developers to take the .AFF and .DIC files to use them in projects with proofing — or spellchecking — functionalities.

I <B>(Marco Pinto)</B> am only improving the en_GB and en_ZA. Kevin Atkinson maintains the en_AU, en_US and en_CA. Please contact Kevin directly for the latter three: https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist, http://wordlist.aspell.net. Dwayne Bailey no longer maintains the en_ZA.

I will release regular updates. AOO/LO admins may disable automatic updates so that when you install their package, you won't be prompted to update the dictionaries.

Both extensions for AOO and LO are identical, the only differences is the wording of <B>“for OpenOffice 4.0+”</B>/<B>“for LibreOffice 4.0+”</B> and the extension sites URLs.

Notice the <B>“2025+_Release_notes.txt”</B> above, where I keep a changelog.

I keep notes of the most recent releases for Mozilla, BlueGriffon, AOO and LO on the Proofing Tool GUI <B>(PTG)</B> website:
https://proofingtoolgui.org


#### Each GitHub folder has:
* .AFF + .DIC + README + WORDLIST + ZIPPED_WORDLIST.  
  
  
#### Licences for the wordlists:
* en_AU <B>(Kevin Atkinson)</B> — BSD/MIT-Like;
* en_CA <B>(Kevin Atkinson)</B> — BSD/MIT-Like;
* en_GB <B>(Marco A.G.Pinto)</B> — LGPL;
* en_US <B>(Kevin Atkinson)</B> — BSD/MIT-Like;
* en_ZA <B>(Marco A.G.Pinto)</B> — LGPL. 
  

#### Suggesting words:

First, check the wordlist .txt file inside the folder of the latest en_GB. If the words aren't there:
* Open an issue or e-mail Marco Pinto ( <B>marcoagpinto AT sapo.pt</B> ) with the suggested words.
  

#### Projects using GB/Proofing Tool GUI:

If you know of any projects that use them, please let me know, and I will list them on the official PTG page.

#### NOTICE:
<B>I have been publicly criticised for my dictionary, even in front of other developers. They only point out flaws instead of suggesting new words or corrections. There are millions of words, and I can't manage them all alone.

This project is very serious. I spend hundreds of EUR every year on web hosting, domains, and a premium Oxford Dictionaries account so that everyone can enjoy quality work for free.

I am a disabled person and open-source is almost all I have left in life.</B>
